- **Render reports** — Per-component render duration and count
- **Slowest components** — Ranked by self render time
- **Most re-rendered** — Ranked by render count
- **Commit timeline** — Chronological view of React commits with durations
- **Commit details** — Per-component breakdown for a specific commit, sorted by self time

CLI commands: `profile start`, `profile stop`, `profile report`, `profile slow`, `profile rerenders`, `profile timeline`, `profile commit`.
